# First General Meeting of 2023!

I almost forgot to post about this, but we had a really nice turnout in our first meeting of the UIL season! Anthony prepared a nice geometry lecture that was easy to 
follow, even for freshman concurrently taking the class, alongside some nice AMC problems with explanations. If you want to take a shot at the problems covered, he 
gave me a list of the problems:
- [2020 AMC 10A Problem 12](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2020_AMC_10A_Problems/Problem_12)

We also had a nice surprise with AHS Class of 2022 graduates Jason Gonzalez (MIT) and Jenny Wei (Stanford) visiting!

As a reminder of meetings for the next two weeks:
- Computer Science: 09/01
- General Math: 09/02, 09/09
- Science: 09/07
 
See y'all next week!
