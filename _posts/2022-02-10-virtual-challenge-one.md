Hey everyone :D If y'all went to hoco I hope y'all enjoyed it!! I just wanted to make a blog post to remind people that the VC1 window starts **tomorrow** and ends on 
October 29th.

## What is VC1?
VC1, or Virtual Challenge (Meet) 1, is the first of a series of practce tests that we can take. We have an open window to take these tests at school during practices, 
and can submit these scores for them to be ranked on the [VC website](https://virtualchallengemeets.com/).

## When can I take it at Lowery?
- Science will be taking it on October 5th
- General Math will be held on October 7th
- Computer Science will be either on October 11th or 25th
- I (Warith) will be taking + proctoring Number Sense and Calculator on October 28th

If you want to take any other competition, just let Ms. Gesh know and she'll be able to print the test and set you up to take that.

## Why should I take this?
This is a great opportunity for you to judge how well you can do on tests from this year, and allow you to set up goals for later in the year to improve!
