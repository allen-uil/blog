# Meeting Dates Changing!!!

Hi everyone! With Physics Club being confirmed to be on Thursdays at STEAM, Eric has decided to move CS meetings to **Tuesdays**. This means that the first meeting will 
not be tomorrow, but instead on the **6th**. Eric will be covering big O notation, like whatever $\mathcal O(N \log N)$ means, and basic searching algorithms. See 
y'all there!
